# conformist.js

Conform lines of text to a fixed-width text box by automatically resizing fonts.

Suitable for both desktop and mobile display. Works with (sans-)serif and monospace fonts.

### To do

* Make it work even when tags (e.g., bold or italic) appear in the middle of a line.

* Monospace fonts are not currently working in the example html, but I have them working in more complicated examples. Perhaps placing the text in a Bootstrap tag with class `.col-md-6` makes them work?

### Requirements

* JQuery v1


### Example usage

See example.html
